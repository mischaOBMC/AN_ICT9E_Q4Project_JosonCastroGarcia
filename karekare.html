        <h3> Recipe:</h3>

        <p>
            Kare-Kare is a rich and savory Filipino stew made with oxtail, tripe, or other meats, and cooked in a creamy peanut sauce. Traditionally served with a side of bagoong (fermented shrimp paste), it's a dish full of flavor and heartiness, often enjoyed during special occasions or family gatherings.<br><br>

<b>Main Ingredients:<br></b>
1 lb (450g) oxtail, cut into pieces (or substitute with beef short ribs, tripe, or pork hock)<br>
1/2 lb (225g) beef tripe (optional, for authentic texture)<br>
1/2 cup peanut butter (smooth or chunky, depending on preference)<br>
1 medium onion, quartered<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 tablespoons annatto seeds (atsuete) or 1 tablespoon annatto powder (for color)<br>
6 cups water (or beef broth for more depth of flavor)<br>
1 medium eggplant, sliced into rounds<br>
1-2 banana blossoms (optional, for added flavor and texture)<br>
1 bunch kangkong (water spinach) or bok choy<br>
1/2 cup string beans (sitaw), cut into 2-3 inch lengths<br>
1 tablespoon fish sauce (or salt), to taste<br>
1 tablespoon bagoong (fermented shrimp paste), for serving<br>
</p>

<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
<b>1. Prepare the Meat<br></b>
-In a large pot, place the oxtail and beef tripe (if using). Cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat<br>.
-Once it starts to boil, skim off any impurities (foam) that rise to the surface, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat becomes tender and the collagen in the oxtail releases, creating a rich broth.<br>
<b>2. Prepare the Annatto Oil<br></b>
-While the meat is simmering, heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.<br>
-Once the oil is hot, add the annatto seeds and cook for about 2-3 minutes until the oil turns a vibrant orange. Remove the seeds and discard them, leaving the annatto-infused oil. Set aside.<br>
<b>3. Make the Peanut Sauce<br></b>
-Once the oxtail is tender, add the onion and garlic to the pot with the meat and continue to simmer for about 10 minutes.<br>
-Stir in the peanut butter, making sure it dissolves into the broth, giving the soup a creamy, peanut-flavored texture.<br>
-Add the annatto oil to the pot for color and flavor. Stir to combine. If the stew gets too thick, you can add a bit more water or broth to reach your desired consistency.<br>
S-eason with fish sauce (or salt) to taste. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld together.<br>
<b>4. Cook the Vegetables<br></b>
-In the last 10-15 minutes of cooking, add the eggplant, string beans, and banana blossoms (if using). Let them cook until tender.<br>
-Add the kangkong (water spinach) or bok choy last, cooking for about 2-3 minutes just until the greens are wilted and tender.<br>
<b>5. Serve<br></b>
-Once the stew is fully cooked and the flavors have developed, remove the pot from the heat.<br>
-Serve the Kare-Kare hot with a side of steamed white rice and a small bowl of bagoong (fermented shrimp paste) on the side for added flavor.<br><br>
Tips:<br><br>

<b>Meat Variations:</b> While oxtail is the most common choice for Kare-Kare, you can substitute or combine with other cuts of beef, pork hock, or even chicken if preferred.<br>
<b>Bagoong:</b> Kare-Kare is traditionally served with a small dish of bagoong (fermented shrimp paste) for a salty contrast to the rich peanut flavor. You can either serve it on the side or mix it directly into the stew.<br>
<b>Peanut Butter:</b> For a more authentic taste, you can make your own peanut paste by blending roasted peanuts. However, store-bought peanut butter works perfectly fine.<br>
<b>Annatto:</b> If you canâ€™t find annatto seeds, you can substitute them with annatto powder or use a little paprika for color, although the flavor will be a bit different.<br><br>
Enjoy your flavorful and creamy Kare-Kare, a Filipino classic that's rich in taste and perfect for family meals or special occasions!
