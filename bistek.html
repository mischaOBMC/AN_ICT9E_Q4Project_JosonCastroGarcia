        <h3> Recipe:</h3>

        <p>
            Bistek Tagalog is a savory Filipino dish made with tender beef, marinated in soy sauce,<br> calamansi (or lemon) juice, and cooked with onions. It's a simple yet flavorful dish that's usually served with steamed rice.<br> Here's a list of the main ingredients:<br><br>

<b>For Bistek Tagalog:</b><br><br>
1 lb (450g) beef sirloin or round steak, thinly sliced against the grain<br>
1 medium onion, peeled and sliced into rings<br>
4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1/4 cup soy sauce<br>
1/4 cup calamansi juice (or substitute with fresh lemon juice)<br>
2 tablespoons cooking oil (for frying)<br>
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional, for added umami flavor)<br>
1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the acidity)<br>
1/2 cup water or beef broth (for simmering)<br>
Salt to taste<br>
Optional: 1-2 tablespoons of cooking wine or vinegar (for extra depth of flavor)<br><br>
Garnish:
Freshly ground black pepper (optional, for extra seasoning)<br><br>
Notes:<br>
Beef cuts: For the best results, use tender cuts like sirloin, rib-eye, or round steak. Thinly slicing against the grain helps ensure the beef is tender after cooking.<br>
Calamansi is a small citrus fruit native to the Philippines and adds a distinctive flavor to the dish. If it's unavailable, lemon juice is a common substitute.

<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Procedure for Bistek Tagalog (Filipino Beef Steak)<br></b>

Bistek Tagalog is a simple yet flavorful dish that features tender beef marinated in soy sauce and calamansi (or lemon) juice, then cooked with onions to create a savory, tangy sauce. Here's how to make it:<br>

<b>1.Marinate the Beef<br></b>
- In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, calamansi (or lemon) juice, minced garlic, ground black pepper, and sugar (if using). <br> 
- Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade and mix well to coat the meat evenly.<br>
- Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. For better flavor, you can marinate it overnight in the refrigerator.<br>

<b>2.Cook the Onions<br></b>
- While the beef is marinating, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat.<br>
- Add the sliced onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. You want the onions to release their sweetness, so don’t rush this step. Set the cooked onions aside for later.<br>

<b>3.Sear the Beef<br></b>
- In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and heat it over medium-high heat.<br>
- Once the oil is hot, remove the beef from the marinade (reserve the marinade for later) and sear the beef slices in batches, ensuring that each piece is browned on both sides. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side.<br>
- Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside. If needed, you can add a bit more oil to the pan.

<b>4.Simmer the Bistek<br></b>
- In the same pan, pour in the reserved marinade and 1/2 cup of water or beef broth (or a little more if you want a sauce with more volume).<br>
- Stir the mixture and bring it to a simmer over medium heat.<br>
- Add the seared beef back into the pan and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the beef becomes tender and the flavors meld together. If using, add oyster sauce for extra depth of flavor.<br>

<b>5.Combine Beef and Onions<br></b>
- Once the beef is tender, return the sautéed onions to the pan and stir to combine. Let everything cook together for an additional 2-3 minutes so the onions soak up the sauce.<br>
  
<b>6.Final Seasoning<br></b>
- Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt or pepper as needed. You can also add a bit more calamansi or lemon juice if you like it tangier.<br>

<b>7.Serve<br></b>
- Serve the Bistek Tagalog hot with a side of steamed white rice. Spoon the flavorful sauce and onions over the beef when serving.<br>

---

<b>Tips: </b> <br>
-Tenderizing the beef: If you're using a tougher cut of beef, you can tenderize it by gently pounding it with a meat mallet before marinating.<br>
- Slightly caramelizing the onions: For a sweeter flavor, you can let the onions caramelize a bit more before adding them to the dish.<br><br>

Enjoy your homemade Bistek Tagalog, a delicious and hearty Filipino classic!
