<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
<b>1. Prepare the Beef<br></b>
-In a large pot, combine the beef shank with bone marrow, onion, garlic, and water (about 6 cups). <br>
-If you have beef broth, you can substitute half or all of the water with it for richer flavor.<br>
-Bring everything to a boil over high heat. <br>
-Once boiling, skim off any scum that rises to the surface to keep the broth clear.<br>
<b>2. Simmer the Beef<br></b>
-Lower the heat to medium-low and let the beef simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat becomes tender and the marrow is soft and slightly melted. <br>
-This will create a rich and flavorful broth. <br>
-Keep an eye on the water level and add more if needed.<br>
<b>3. Season the Broth<br></b>
-Add fish sauce, salt, and peppercorns to the pot for seasoning. <br>
-Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning to your preference.<br>
If youâ€™re adding corn, drop the pieces into the pot now and let it simmer with the beef for about 30-45 minutes, until the corn is tender.
<b>4. Add the Vegetables<br></b>
-Once the beef and corn are tender, add the potatoes, carrots, and string beans (sitaw).<br> 
-Continue simmering for another 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked through.<br>
-Add the bok choy (pechay) and the cabbage (if using) in the last few minutes of cooking, just enough to wilt them but retain their bright color and freshness.<br>
<b>5. Final Adjustments<br></b>
-Taste the soup one last time and adjust the seasoning if necessary, adding more fish sauce, salt, or pepper as needed.<br>
<b>6. Serve<br></b>
-Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure to include a generous portion of beef, bone marrow, vegetables, and broth.<br>
-Serve with steamed rice and calamansi or lemon wedges on the side for added tang, if desired.<br><br>

<b>Tips:<br><br></b>

-Bone marrow: The marrow is the star of this dish. It becomes soft and rich after simmering for hours, adding deep flavor to the broth. <br>You can scoop it out and spread it on rice, if you like.<br>

-Skimming the broth: It's important to remove any impurities (scum) that rise to the surface while simmering the beef to keep the broth clean and clear.<br>

-Broth richness: For a richer, more flavorful broth, you can simmer the beef <br>for longer (up to 3 hours), ensuring that the marrow and collagen break down fully.
Bulalo is a comforting and filling meal, perfect for sharing with <br>family and friends. Enjoy your delicious, steaming bowl of Bulalo!<br>
