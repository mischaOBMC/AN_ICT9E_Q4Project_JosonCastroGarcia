        <h3> Recipe:</h3>

        <p>
           Tinola is a comforting Filipino chicken soup flavored with ginger, garlic, and fish sauce, and typically served with leafy greens and green papaya or chayote. It's a soothing and delicious dish often enjoyed during colder months or when you're feeling under the weather. Here are the key ingredients:<br>

<b>Main Ingredients:<br></b>
1 whole chicken, cut into serving pieces (or 2-3 lbs chicken parts like thighs, drumsticks, or wings)<br>
1 tablespoon fish sauce (patis)<br>
1 medium onion, quartered<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, sliced thinly or julienned<br>
6 cups water (or chicken broth for extra flavor)<br>
1-2 medium green papayas, peeled, seeded, and sliced into wedges (or chayote if papaya is unavailable)<br>
1 bunch malunggay (moringa) leaves, or spinach or kale (for a substitute)<br>
2 long green chili peppers (optional, for a bit of heat)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for sautéing)<br>

<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
<b>1. Prepare the Chicken<br></b>
-In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.<br>
-Once the oil is hot, add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes until the onion softens and the ginger becomes aromatic.<br>
<b>2. Cook the Chicken<br></b>
-Add the chicken pieces into the pot. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally to lightly brown the chicken and develop more flavor.<br>
-Add the fish sauce, and continue to sauté for another 1-2 minutes.<br>
<b>3. Add Water and Simmer<br></b>
-Pour in 6 cups of water (or chicken broth). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.<br>
-Let the chicken cook for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken becomes tender and fully cooked. Skim off any impurities (foam) that rise to the surface for a clearer broth.<br>
<b>4. Add Papaya or Chayote<br></b>
-Once the chicken is tender, add the papaya wedges (or chayote). Let it cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the papaya is tender and has absorbed the flavor of the broth.<br>
<b>5. Season the Broth<br></b>
-Taste the soup and add salt and pepper to your preference. You can also add more fish sauce if you prefer a stronger, more savory flavor.<br>
<b>6. Add the Greens<br></b>
-Add the malunggay leaves (moringa) or substitute with spinach or kale. Add the green chili peppers (if using), and simmer for another 2-3 minutes just to wilt the greens.<br>
<b>7. Serve<br></b>
-Once everything is cooked and the flavors have melded together, remove the pot from the heat.<br>
-Serve your Tinola hot with steamed rice on the side. You can squeeze some calamansi (or lemon) over the soup for added tang, if desired.<br>
<b>Tips:<br><br></b>

<b>Meat Choices: </b>Traditionally, chicken is used, but you can also make Tinola with pork or even fish, depending on what you prefer or have available.<br>
<b>Vegetable Variations:</b> If green papaya is unavailable, chayote or even potatoes can be used as a substitute. The papaya gives a mild sweetness and soft texture to the soup.<br>
<b>Spice Level: </b>Adjust the amount of green chili peppers depending on how spicy you want your Tinola to be. You can leave them out entirely for a milder dish.<br>
<b>Malunggay (Moringa): </b>If you can’t find malunggay leaves, spinach, or kale work as great substitutes, though they won’t provide the same earthy flavor.<br><br>
Enjoy your warm, soothing bowl of Tinola, perfect for family meals or whenever you need a comforting dish to make you feel good!
