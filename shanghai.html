        <h3> Recipe:</h3>

        <p>
           Lumpiang Shanghai is a Filipino-style spring roll filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, shrimp, and vegetables. It's deep-fried to a crispy golden brown and is often served as a snack, appetizer, or party dish. Here are the ingredients for making this popular Filipino dish<br><br>

<b></b>Main Ingredients:<br><br>
1 lb (450g) ground pork (or a combination of ground pork and ground beef)<br>
1/2 lb (225g) shrimp, peeled, deveined, and finely chopped<br>
1 medium onion, finely chopped<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1 small carrot, grated or finely chopped<br>
1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped<br>
1/4 cup water chestnuts (optional, for added crunch), finely chopped<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce<br>
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional, for extra umami)<br>
1 egg, beaten (for binding the mixture)<br>
2-3 tablespoons cornstarch or flour (optional, to help bind the filling)<br>
Spring roll wrappers (lumpia wrappers), available at most Asian grocery stores<br>
Vegetable oil for frying<br><br>
<b>For Dipping Sauce:<br></b>
1/4 cup ketchup<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
1 tablespoon vinegar (optional, for a tangy kick)<br>
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)<br>

<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
<b>1. Prepare the Filling<br></b>
-In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground pork, chopped shrimp, onion, garlic, carrot, green onions, and water chestnuts (if using).
Add the salt, pepper, soy sauce, and oyster sauce (if using).<br>
-Mix everything well.<br>
-Add the beaten egg and stir to combine. If the mixture feels too loose or wet, you can add a little cornstarch or flour to help bind it together.<br>
<b>2. Fill the Lumpia Wrappers<br></b>
-Lay a spring roll wrapper on a clean, flat surface, with one corner pointing toward you (like a diamond shape).<br>
-Place about 1-2 tablespoons of the filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper.<br>
-Roll tightly from the bottom, folding in the sides as you go, like a burrito, until you reach the top.<br>
-Brush a small amount of water or flour paste (a mixture of water and flour) along the top edge to seal the roll. Press gently to seal the wrapper securely.<br>
-Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.<br>
<b>3. Fry the Lumpia<br></b>
-Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 350°F (175°C) for frying. You can test this by dropping a small piece of the wrapper into the oil—if it sizzles, the oil is ready.<br>
-Carefully place the spring rolls into the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.<br>
-Fry for about 3-5 minutes, or until the lumpia are golden brown and crispy. Turn them occasionally to ensure even frying on all sides.<br>
-Once cooked, remove the lumpia from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.<br>
<b>4. Prepare the Dipping Sauce<br></b>
-In a small bowl, mix together ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, and vinegar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. You can add garlic powder for extra flavor, if desired.<br>
Adjust the sauce to your taste, adding more sugar for sweetness or vinegar for tang.<br>
<b>5. Serve<br></b>
-Serve the Lumpiang Shanghai hot with the dipping sauce on the side.<br>

<b>Tips:<br><br></b>

-Filling Variations: You can also add finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, green beans, or bell peppers for more texture and flavor.
-Freezing: If you have leftovers or want to prepare in advance, you can freeze the un-fried lumpia. Just place them on a baking sheet in a single layer, freeze until solid, then transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Fry them directly from frozen when you're ready to serve.
-Crispiness: Ensure the oil is hot enough before frying to get the lumpia crispy. If the oil is too cold, the lumpia may absorb too much oil and become soggy.
Enjoy your crispy, savory Lumpiang Shanghai—a beloved Filipino snack that's perfect for parties, gatherings, or simply as a delicious treat!
