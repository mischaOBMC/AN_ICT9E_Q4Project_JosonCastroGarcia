        <p>
            Calamares is a popular Filipino dish made from battered and deep-fried squid rings, often served as an appetizer or snack. It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, making it a favorite in Filipino cuisine. Here are the ingredients needed:<br><br>

<b>Main Ingredients:<br></b>
1 lb fresh squid (about 4-6 medium squid), cleaned and cut into rings<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
1/2 cup cornstarch<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional, for a bit of flavor and color)<br>
1 egg, beaten<br>
1/2 cup cold water (adjust as needed to achieve a thick batter)<br>
Vegetable oil for frying<br>
<b>For Dipping Sauce (optional):<br></b>
1/4 cup mayonnaise<br>
1 tablespoon ketchup<br>
1 teaspoon calamansi or lemon juice<br>
1/2 teaspoon sugar<br>
A pinch of salt and pepper to taste<br>

<h3> Procedure:</h3>

        <p>
           

<b>1. Prepare the Squid<br></b>
-Clean the squid by removing the head, tentacles, and innards. Peel off the skin, if desired, and rinse thoroughly. Pat the squid dry with paper towels.<br>
-Cut the squid into rings, about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Set aside.<br>
<b>2. Make the Batter<br></b>
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using).<br>
-Add the beaten egg and gradually stir in the cold water until the batter reaches a thick, smooth consistency. It should be thick enough to coat the squid rings but not too runny.<br>
<b>3. Coat the Squid<br></b>
Dip the squid rings into the batter, making sure they are fully coated.<br>
Shake off any excess batter before frying to ensure a crisp coating.<br>
<b>4. Fry the Calamares<br></b>
Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok over medium-high heat. The oil should be around 350°F (175°C) for frying.<br>
Carefully drop the battered squid rings into the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.<br>
Fry for about 2-4 minutes, or until the squid is golden brown and crispy. The squid cooks quickly, so don’t leave it in the oil for too long to avoid overcooking.<br>
Remove the fried calamares from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.<br>
<b>5. Prepare the Dipping Sauce (optional)<br></b>
In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, ketchup, calamansi (or lemon juice), sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir until smooth and well-combined.<br>
<b>6. Serve<br></b>
Serve the Calamares hot with the dipping sauce on the side.<br><br>
<b>Tips:</b><br><br>

<b>Squid Size:</b> If you're using larger squid, you can cut them into thicker rings. For smaller squid, you can leave them whole or cut into smaller rings.<br>
<b>Crispiness:</b> For an even crispier texture, you can double coat the squid by dipping them into the batter and then rolling them in extra flour or breadcrumbs before frying.<br>
<b>Alternative Dips:</b> Calamares is also great with vinegar or sweet chili sauce if you prefer a different dipping option.<br>

Enjoy your crispy, flavorful Calamares, a delightful Filipino dish that pairs perfectly with cold drinks and good company!
